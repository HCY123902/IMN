<djtansey> does anyone here have k3b experience? i can record things with cdrecord but k3b won't let me (did k3bsetup and all and it seems happy. but k3b says my device isn't a cd writer) __eou__ <Nafallo> djtansey: k3b won't work with kernel 2.6.8|2.6.8.1 __eou__ <djtansey> Nafallo: so go back to 2.6.7? __eou__ <Nafallo> djtansey: yepp, or upgrade to 2.6.9 __eou__ <CPayan> hmm progression or regression __eou__ <djtansey> Nafallo: thanks. i'll see if ubuntu has 2.6.9 packaged __eou__ <jdub> it will work with the ubuntu kernel __eou__ <djtansey> jdub: k3b will? __eou__ <jdub> no, there's no 2.6.9 in warty or hoary __eou__ <jdub> yes __eou__ <jdub> there are plenty of people using it __eou__ <Nafallo> jdub: never worked with ANY 2.6 for me :-P __eou__ <djtansey> jdub: then any guess as to what the problem is? __eou__ <Nafallo> jdub: that's with both ubuntu and debian kernels. __eou__ <jdub> dunno if there's a FAQ or something on the website, but it would make sense to check __eou__ <djtansey> jdub: i did. nothing i could find that was related __eou__ <Nafallo> opss, typo! 2.6.8* ;-) __eou__ <djtansey> jdub: other than some k3bsetup .ICEauthority issues __eou__ <djtansey> Nafallo: but it works with 2.6.7 for you? __eou__ <Nafallo> jdub: k3b and 2.6.8|2.6.8.1 on both my computers with burners fail. __eou__ <Nafallo> djtansey: yes. __eou__ <Nafallo> djtansey: and it should be fixed in 2.6.9 also :-) __eou__ <jdub> Nafallo: the ubuntu kernels do not have those bugs. __eou__ <djtansey> Nafallo: thanks. __eou__ <jdub> plenty of other people are using k3b with ubuntu __eou__ <Nafallo> jdub: how come when I TRIED with ubuntu k3b couldn't see my burner? __eou__ <Nafallo> jdub: same thing with my girlfriend. __eou__ <jdub> i don't know your particular circumstances __eou__ <jdub> i can only relate what i know __eou__ <Nafallo> it just doesn't work :-) __eou__ <Nafallo> jdub: same here. __eou__ <jdub> that may be true in your case __eou__ <jdub> but it is not the case for many other users __eou__ <Nafallo> jdub: maybe it's just drive specific? __eou__ <jdub> i don't know __eou__ <Nafallo> jdub: but then, I got both a samsung and a toshiba ;-). __eou__ <Nafallo> it might be that I'm running my cd-rws as ide-cd :-) __eou__ <djtansey> Nafallo: but i can use cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc without problem. you'd think k3b would be equally capable __eou__ <Nafallo> djtansey: yepp, I've given up on the subject anyway :-P. ubuntu showed me the way nautilus does it :-P. __eou__ <djtansey> Nafallo: usually that's what i do. unfortunately i am burning audio CDs for a roadtrip :) __eou__ <ajmitch> djtansey: running k3b with sudo? __eou__ <ajmitch> not that it should matter with the patched kernel __eou__ <djtansey> ajmitch: no. but i gave k3b my root password so those apps have root permissions __eou__ <Nafallo> djtansey: k3b doesn't have root permissions. __eou__ <Nafallo> djtansey: cdrecord and cdrdao have :-). __eou__ <djtansey> Nafallo: that's why i meants by "those apps." would giving k3b root help? (not that it matters now. i just finished my last CD using cdrecord) __eou__

<MartenH> What does this error mean and how can I correct it? http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/910 __eou__ <MartenH> Some help anyone? http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/910 __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, ty __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: no worries :) __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, it tells me it can't lock /var/lib/dpkg (and btw, uname should be uname or my username?) __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: close synaptic or whatever other instance of apt is running: type the command literally as i gave it __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, sorry, forgot i had synaptic open in another workspace. getting the pacakge now __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: easy to do ;) __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: just FYI, the $(uname -r) part of that expands to your kernel version ( type uname -r to see what I mean) __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, I figured that out on my own :) But thanks, it's always nice to know what I'm doing and not just follow blindly __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: cool :) And yes, that's why I mentioned it __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, I guess I need gcc to. will that package suffice or should I get any of the multitude of other gcc packages avaliabe __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: sudo apt-get install build-essential __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, ah ok, ty __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: apt-cache show build-essential for info :) __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, noted :) __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: for more info than you ever dreamed of, sudo apt-get install apt-howto-en ; then run apt-howto froma terminal ! ;-) __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: or the equivalent package for your language of course... __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, ok :) __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/912 please? __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, it almost looks like the file I downloaded wasn't correct.. odd.. it is stated as working __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: this one I can't help with, I'm afraid __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: are you following a howto? __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, darn. ok well I'll try another version and hopefully it won't have those errors __eou__ <MartenH> thoreauputic, yes, however it only stated to run the "make" command which, as you see, isn't wokring :/ __eou__ <thoreauputic> MartenH: check to see if you need automake __eou__
<ubuntu_> !paste __eou__ <yhager> ubuntu_: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl __eou__ <ubuntu_> yhager, http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/911 __eou__ <yhager> ubuntu_: it looks like it is configured correctly to boot into linux. Try to increase the delay to 200, so you'll have 20 seconds to play with the boot menu __eou__ <yhager> ubuntu_: you'll need to run lilo after the change.. __eou__ <ubuntu_> yhager, and how i must do that? __eou__ <yhager> ubuntu_: If I remember correctly, just run 'lilo' from the command line, although the case may be different if you booted from a livecd. Check the man page (man lilo, man lilo.conf) __eou__ <f_newton> ubuntu uses lilo? __eou__ <f_newton> I thought it was grub __eou__ <rajiv_> I think its Gurb __eou__ <thoreauputic> sudo lilo -v is "verbose" and helps if you made an error __eou__ <ubuntu_> yhager, thanx for wasted time on me... __eou__ <jasoncohen> f_newton, grub is used on i386 and amd64 i think __eou__ <f_newton> lilo is limited and obsolete __eou__ <yhager> f_newton: yes, it's grub, but ubuntu_ is pretty sure he is using lilo.. :) __eou__ <jasoncohen> f_newton, lilo is used on ppc i believe and i know it's used on LVM root partitions __eou__ <jasoncohen> grub can't boot off LVM __eou__ <thoreauputic> jasoncohen: ppc uses "yaboot" __eou__ <jasoncohen> thoreauputic, oh __eou__ <yhager> ubuntu_: you're welcome __eou__

<tongueroo> hey guys, wondering, so when something gets compiled and built onto a system, eventually what results are binary files and executables, if i were to take the binary files and executables and copy them over to another system with the same architecture x86, would they just work? __eou__ <tongueroo> im thinking about deployments and long compile times when i need to spin up a bunch of more servers __eou__ <joaopinto> tongueroo, if you have the same libraries for which those binaries are linked to in the other system, yes __eou__ <fccf> tongueroo: provided they are running the same kernel, have all necessarry libraries, and dependencies __eou__ <joaopinto> tongueroo, why not just build the .deb packages ? __eou__ <tongueroo> joaopinto : ic, actually we're on gentoo in production __eou__ <joaopinto> tongueroo, ah ok :\ __eou__ <tongueroo> which tends to build everything from source, hence the question __eou__ <tongueroo> yeah, im in the wrong room :) __eou__ <joaopinto> tongueroo, that might be a problem, don't expect library versions compatibility between gentoo and ubuntu __eou__ <joaopinto> tongueroo, you could setup an ubuntu chroot on the gentoo server __eou__ <tongueroo> interesting, k, good to know, ive always have wondered that, just havent had the chance to try it out yet :) __eou__ <tongueroo> joaopinto: interesting, is chroot-ing similar to running vm's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot __eou__ <joaopinto> tongueroo, well, kind of,, it is just virtualized in the filesystem structure sense __eou__ <joaopinto> but because on linux most of the resources are file structure based, yes, it behaves like a very light vm __eou__ <tongueroo> ic, cool __eou__

<BobTheGreat> Linux is such total shit. There always the tinkering, halfsolved problem. Even windows XP is lighyears ahead. Never had an unproblematic wifi connection under linux. I seems like the install/uninstall are not consistent, ever. The fresh install is nice, but once you start adjusting it to your needs it quickly turns to unreliable, ad-hoc, bullshit. Had to be said. __eou__ <EvoGamer> BobTheGreat, no it didn't have to be said __eou__ <lotuspsychje> linux rox __eou__ <BobTheGreat> :) it did. linux people need to fix their focus if there will ever be a year of linux desktop. __eou__ <IdleOne> !language | BobTheGreat __eou__ <ubottu> BobTheGreat: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional. __eou__ <edbian> BobTheGreat: If you want help ask for it.

You will see drivers better than the proprietary evolving __eou__ <BobTheGreat> BlouBlou, yes actually I did. How do I restore kernel/wifi to "factory settings" in 11.04? __eou__ <BlouBlou> BobTheGreat: reinstalling it? __eou__ <BobTheGreat> BlouBlou, "it"? __eou__ <BlouBlou> BobTheGreat: what did you change in kernel? what's your exactly problem? __eou__ <sudokill> his attitude __eou__ <BobTheGreat> BlouBlou, I got rid of the 2.6.39, but wifi still doesn't show list of ap's. Apparently it is no longer working. Also, I have not changed anything about wifi, just installed 2.6.39 and uninstalled it, and did a update-grub. __eou__ <BlouBlou> BobTheGreat: then what's the problem? __eou__ <BobTheGreat> BlouBlou, "wifi still doesn't show list of ap's. Apparently it is no longer working." Prior to the kernel change/rechange, wifi worked but not with wpa. Not it is totalled. For all I know alot of things got broken by changing the kernel back and forth. __eou__ <BlouBlou> BobTheGreat: then install the maverick's kernel, it works fine for natty (I tried it and no problems) __eou__

<groob> I'm dual booting 2 ubuntu systems (both are 16.04).  Call them OS1 and OS2.  Currently grub is installed from OS1, so update-grub only has an effect when run from OS1.  What is the best way to get the bootloader to automatically update if OS2 has a kernel update? __eou__ <corba> groob, I guess the easiest way is to instal grub customizer in os2, and when you update the kernel, also update grub from grub-customizer __eou__ <groob> corba: Thanks!  That won't be automated though, right? __eou__ <corba> nope, and i dont know if it will correctly update the grub because the past update was in /boot from OS1 __eou__ <corba> but you can give it a try, i always use it to update grub graphically, change font, background image... __eou__ <groob> corba: Ah ok.  Yea, that's the issue that I'm hitting.  Each OS has a seperate /boot that is updated.  I suspect that the solution would require OS2 to change the /boot location to be the same as OS1. __eou__ <corba> groob, you could put /boot on a separate partition :) __eou__ <groob> corba: Hmm... You might be on to something there haha __eou__ <corba> groob, but why do you need two OS? __eou__ <groob> corba: "reasons" __eou__ * genii ponders OS/2 __eou__ <corba> groob, virtualization wouldnt do the trick? __eou__ <groob> corba: I'm running 2 filesystems and also I just like to keep things isolated. __eou__ <groob> corba: I tried virtualization but the performance just isn't that great on my hardware sadly. __eou__ <groob> corba: Thanks for the help!  I'll try using a dedicated boot partition instead.  The biggest downside that I can think of is that the partition order in the menu will change depending on which OS ran update-grub last.  If that could be solved, then it would be perfect. __eou__ <corba> partition order? __eou__ <groob> corba: Err, I mean the order of the operating systems.  OS1 appears first currently, but if OS2 ran update-grub, it would cause OS2 to be listed first. __eou__ <corba> groob, you could change that with grub-customizer easily __eou__ <groob> corba: Oh, cool.  Good to know!  Thanks! __eou__ <corba> you need to install it through the ppa though __eou__ <Bashing-om> groob: There can be only one boot control authority per hard drive . What I do is disable 30_os-prober in the seconday system,' sudo update-grub' amd in the primary also 'sudo apt-update-grub' to propogate the changes to the system(s) . __eou__ <Bashing-om> groob: Typo .. sudo apt-update-grub' s/b ' sudo update-grub ' __eou__ <groob> Bashing-om: Thanks!  Won't that still require manually running update-grub every time the kernel updates though? __eou__ <Bashing-om> groob: Yes that is true / 'sudo update-grub ' will be needed ach time the kernel is changed . But that is no big deal, is it ? __eou__ <groob> Bashing-om: It's not a huge deal.  It's what I'm currently doing.  I update the kernel in the secondary OS followed by running update-grub within the primary OS. __eou__ <groob> Bashing-om: I was just hoping that there was an easy way to automate it, that's all. __eou__ <groob> Bashing-om: But thanks! __eou__ <Bashing-om> groob: My expeprience with out disabling 30_os-prober in my secondary systems is that there is the propability of recurssion in the primary grub.cfg file . __eou__ <groob> Bashing-om: Ah, I see.  Currently I just have 2 /boot directories, so nothing conflicts.  When OS2 has a kernel update, it just updates a /boot that is never used.  If I set up a decidated boot partition, I'll take note of that.  Thanks __eou__

<test12345_> So has anybody here used phpvirtualbox recently? i installed ubuntu 16.04 server yesterday, but i seem to be to stupid to setup phpvirtualbox haha __eou__ <corba> test12345_, i use normal virtualbox daily not problems with it __eou__ <test12345_> yeah i thinkj normal one works, it is just that i dont have gui on the srever, and doing everything via VBoxManage and cli seems a lot of work (especially if you never did it) __eou__ <tomreyn> test12345_: you could use libvirt + kvm on the server and virt-manager on the client __eou__ <test12345_> tomreyn: ah i might look into that also seems like an idea __eou__
<zacky83> Hi everybody , my fail2ban does not seem to be active , I keep getting asterisk hacking attempts but I never see result in fail2ban log __eou__ <groob> zacky83: Did you copy the config file in /etc/fail2ban after you installed it?  By default I think fail2ban does nothing. __eou__ <zacky83> groob I don't have any /etc/fail2ban directory under my ubuntu server __eou__ <groob> zacky83: Did you install fail2ban already?  If so, was it installed by running "sudo apt-get install fail2ban"? __eou__ <zacky83> groob yes , it is installed __eou__ <zacky83> groob in fail2ban.log I have 2016-12-19 21:06:25,137 fail2ban.jail   : INFO   Jail 'asterisk-tcp' started __eou__ <groob> zacky83: I'm not really sure then.  When I installed it (using the guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fail2ban ), I had to "cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local" before it worked.  If you don't have that directory, however, then I'm not sure what to do. __eou__ <zacky83> groob sorry ,I have this directory , I have jail.conf in it but not jail.local __eou__ <groob> zacky83: Ah, ok good!  The first thing that I always do is copy the jail.conf to jail.local.  Then add all of the necessary configuration changes to jail.local. __eou__ <zacky83> groob , how can /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/asterisk.conf be taken in account for fail2ban ? __eou__ <groob> zacky83: That I'm not sure about unfortunately.  Perhaps someone else knows?  I've never used that fail2ban filter. __eou__

<devn0ll> What do you guys recommend for copying/cloning a directory? (eg cloning /storage1 to /storage2 locally) -- Its about 3TB data, both large single files and very small ones.
