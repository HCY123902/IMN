<stig_> how can I get access to my NTFS files from ubuntu? (fresh newbie asking) :) __eou__ <holycow> stig_, unfortunately for now it requires a bit of work __eou__ <holycow> a: you will only be able to read the ntfs files __eou__ <holycow> b) you wont be able to write to an ntfs partition __eou__ <stig_> I only need to read from it :) __eou__ <holycow> ms keeps ntfs info secret, and any interim support for write has essentially dissapeared as no one cares enough to maintain the components __eou__ <holycow> okay __eou__ <holycow> then __eou__ <holycow> 1. you need to find your ntfs partition with sudo fdisk -l __eou__ <holycow> 2. you need to create a folder in say /media to wher eyou will mount to the ntfs partition ... mine is /media/ntfs __eou__ <holycow> 3. you need to add info about the partition to your /etc/fstab __eou__ <jonbusby> stig_ the ubuntuguide.org is really good on this __eou__ <holycow> i'll paste a sample that i use __eou__ <holycow> oh i don't have the line on this system __eou__ <stig_> holycow: I think I made it it point 3... but dont know how I do that __eou__ <holycow> google for fstab mount ntfs ... you will get lots of examples of the entry __eou__ <holycow> the 4. sudo mount /media/ntfs __eou__ <stig_> ok, thanks __eou__ <holycow> then 5. you can browse to /metdia/ntfs and read the files from there __eou__ <holycow> i presume in the future some outomount feature will be available, not sure __eou__ <holycow> stig_, google step 3 then :) you will need to reaserch a bit, i don't intend on teaching you how to use nano or whatever :) __eou__ <AfroDude> dosen't Ubuntu support read/write to NTFS disks? __eou__ <holycow> read yes __eou__ <holycow> write no __eou__ <holycow> no linux distro properly supports ntfs writes __eou__ <AfroDude> how/where can I reach it? __eou__ <holycow> ntfs is proprietary and undocumented, and the project that used the windows dlls to do writing is no longer supported, primarily because no one really cares __eou__ <holycow> reach what? __eou__ <AfroDude> a disk with NTFS file system. Tried /dev/hd1, but couldn't open it :/ __eou__ <holycow> let me paste instructions i just gave to anothe guy 2 minutes ago __eou__ <holycow> holycow 1. you need to find your ntfs partition with sudo fdisk -l __eou__ <holycow> holycow 2. you need to create a folder in say /media to wher eyou will mount to the ntfs partition ... mine is /media/ntfs __eou__ <holycow> holycow 3. you need to add info about the partition to your /etc/fstab __eou__ <holycow> google step 3, i dont have sample line here __eou__ <holycow> holycow the 4. sudo mount /media/ntfs __eou__ <holycow> holycow then 5. you can browse to /metdia/ntfs and read the files from there __eou__ <AfroDude> ok, thanks __eou__

<Vjaz> Anyone here successfully installed a 2.6.12 kernel on Hoary? __eou__ <Vjaz> I wanted to try 2.6.12 on my Hoary system, but I ran into trouble. First it wouldn't even boot, and when it did my sound card didn't work and I think I recall some other quirks too. __eou__ <delire> Vjaz: always wait a couple of months before trying out a new kernel ;) __eou__ <Vjaz> delire: Hehhe. Yeah, that's a good idea. :-) __eou__ <delire> Vjaz: i have had problems here also, and i've been compiling kernels since v2.1 __eou__ <Vjaz> delire, There was an infrared driver patch that I really wanted in 2.6.12. __eou__ <Vjaz> delire, Yeah, I'm no stranger to compiling my own kernel. It seems to me that Ubuntu is a different animal than Gentoo or Debian kernel wise. __eou__ <delire> Vjaz: i wanted some new bluetooth and Asus stuff.. __eou__ <delire> Vjaz: it is a little. i think the best approach with Ubuntu is let the maintainers ship the kernel for you. __eou__ <Vjaz> delire, Yeah. I might wait until Breezy I guess. I think I'll need to do a BIOS upgrade on my laptop before I can even use that infrared stuff, so unless I find myself wiping my hard drive to install Windows or buying a USB floppy drive, I don't think it's a problem just yet. __eou__ <delire> Vjaz: well given the Ubuntu release cycle, you won't have to wait for long.. another few months __eou__ <Vjaz> delire, Yeah, it's nice. I can't use my infrared before that though, but I haven't been able to do that before either, so it's not much of a problem. I might install vanilla Debian or something to see if it works while waiting. __eou__ <delire> Vjaz: well i'm going to wait a month or so. i run debian on this lappie __eou__ <Vjaz> delire, Ok. It probably is a good idea to wait a while to see that there are no major problems with the kernel, I guess. __eou__

Again? __eou__ <berkes> I bought a SMC card, that is supposed to work out of the box with the prism45 in ubuntu __eou__ <berkes> firmware and all should be right. __eou__ <berkes> It is detected, the leds are all happy and stuff __eou__ <berkes> however, iwconfig gives me a "NOT READY!" __eou__ <berkes> so, qnyone on wireless with a prism45 ? __eou__ <berkes> allright, lemme try again ;) anyone here who can help me with my wireless prism45 card? __eou__ <delire> berkes: sadly not, i use a Centrino here. __eou__ <berkes> delire, what module does that one use? __eou__ <delire> berkes: 'modprobe -l | grep prism' __eou__ <berkes> delire, my prism is loaded properly __eou__ <delire> berkes: can you 'sudo iwconfig'? __eou__
<narkceh> sudo echo fglrx >> /etc/modules | permission denied. Why? __eou__ <Vjaz> narkceh, because you're trying to open /etc/modules as a regular user. what you're doing is essentially running "echo fglrx" with sudo and redirecting it to /etc/modules. You should run "sudo -s" or "sudo su -" and then run "echo fglrx >> /etc/modules" __eou__ <CarlFK> narkceh - either the "enter password" is being >> to something you don't have rights to yet, or the sudo only applies to the echo fglrx __eou__ <narkceh> Vjaz: ok, thanks. got it. __eou__ <Vjaz> narkceh, I do the same thing all the time. It's a bit non-intuitive I guess, but makes sense. :-) __eou__ <narkceh> Vjaz: yeah, this ubuntu is pretty new for me for example I allways forget sudo when installing something. __eou__

<vee_> danbhfive: I am at the point Guided, but which one ; entire disk / entire disk and set up LVM / entire disk and set up encrypted LVM? then theres the first- resize (which is prolly what i dont want) and manual __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ dont you want the first?  I don't know, I always have chosen manual  :( __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ if you choose manual, all you need to do is have at least one partition marked as / __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive choosing manual __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: now i see Guided / Help partioneg below that are two SATA drives - one has a submenu __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive # 1 primary and #5 logical __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ mmk, are they partitioned? __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ how much do you know about partitioning? __eou__ <vee_> when it comes to linux - 0 __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ how about in windows? ie not linux? __eou__ <vee_> windows an d mac - yes __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: win and mac yes __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ how would you partition in those cases __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ i mean, im not sure if I know what you need, you could just format them both to ext3, set one to mount as / and the other to something like /media/other __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive most of the available space would go to data, if I have two or more drives I drop my data from one HD to another __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: system then two partitions (equal in size but way bigger than system) for data __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ well, if you mount one drive as /, basically everything will go there __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: I will be placing my Mac and Windows files on the data partitions as well __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ are you dual booting? or try booting? __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: I would like one drive with a good size partition for system and apps, plus a much bigger portion for M and W data backup, while the other drive I want to store just M and W data __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: i dont want to ever have a chance of messing up the system (ha) __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ but are you dual booting?  i didnt think you were, are you talking about when you actually setup the ftp? __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: at this point no, in the future i will purchase a separate drive for that __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: i really want this machine to be a server (another ha) __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ then dont bother with partitioning much, you want to use ALL the space for linux __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ linux will be holding the files for other OS's, in fact, at this point, it doesnt matter __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: ok, so should i click on each and partition the entire device __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ yeah, just one big partition for now __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive: creating new partition tables for each right now __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ you should just get things up and running as close as you can to how you want __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ you can worry about more fancy partitioning later __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive kewl __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive ok both say under there sub menus: pri/log 500.1 GB FREE SPACE, im clcking FINISH partitioning and write changes to disk __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive ok both say under there sub menus: pri/log 500.1 GB FREE SPACE, im clcking FINISH partitioning and write changes to disk, now when I go to finish it says no /root found __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ did you set one of the partitions to /  ? __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive shoudl one be logical and one be primary? __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ nah __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ thats only if you are breaking up the harddrives into several partitions __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive im clearing them again (thanx for baring with me) __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive both say FREE SPACE under them, now what __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_  wait, did you informat them? __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive i clciked manual under the partitioning menu __eou__ <danbhfive> ok, i would use synaptic then, and resolve those broken dependencies __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive then i hit <enter> with each drive selected __eou__ <danbhfive> uninstall any package that doesnt have a valid source __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ are the drives formatted at this point? __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive it then asked me whether or not to create new empty partition table __eou__ <Chronosphear> how do i get a list of packages that don't have a valid source? __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive i said yes to both __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive dioes that mena they are formatted? __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ i dont know __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ its graphical isnt it?  if it says "free space" then its not formated __eou__ <danbhfive> Chronosphear look under Installed (local or obsolete) __eou__ <danbhfive> get rid of those, unless its something that you personally put there __eou__ <Chronosphear> danbhfive, ah, thanks __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ you lost me at some point __eou__ <me> danbhfive, no, I'm still here. __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ you should format the drive, AND set the mount point __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive if I select a dirve then hit <enter> I see a menu for Create a new Partition, Auto part. the free space, or Show Cylinder/head/Sector Info __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive does that sound familiar? __eou__ <danbhfive> is it all freespace right now? __eou__ <vee_> yes __eou__ <vee_> both drives __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ ok, yes, click create a new drive button, where ever that is __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ then select ext3, and then look for a place to set the mount point __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ set the mount point to / __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive ok but first i have to select logical or primary to get to that menu __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive which one? __eou__ <danbhfive> primary __eou__ <danbhfive> logical is if you are creating more than 4 partitions, and you are only making one __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ did it work? __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive  ok I have this set for the first drive.... Use as= Ext3 journaling file sys. Mount point=  /home,  Mount options= defaults, Label= None, reserved Blocks= 5%, Typical usage= standard, bootable flag= off __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive  hows that? __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ the mount point should be just / __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive  ok __eou__ <Chronosphear> danbhfive, the applets are still broken. any other ideas? __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ Chronospear did you successfully run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^ ? __eou__ <danbhfive> Chronospear did you successfully run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^ ? __eou__ <Chronosphear> no, it keeps getting stock on libnss and firefox __eou__ <Chronosphear> stuck* __eou__ <Chronosphear> hrmm that's weird __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive  what should I set the second drive to  logical or primary? then i can get to the menu to set the other options __eou__ <vee_> or just leave it as free space __eou__ <danbhfive> Chronospear well, I dont know about the applets, but you still dont yet have a full ubuntu install __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ do it the same as the first, with a different mount point __eou__ <Chronosphear> danbhfive, when i do apt-get autoremove it says there is nothing to uninstall BUT when i got to install libnss it says: __eou__ <Chronosphear> The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: __eou__ <Chronosphear>   planner ekiga libgsf-gnome-1-114 libpth20 libgoffice-0-common abiword-gnome dia-libs gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly rhythmbox abiword-common __eou__ <Chronosphear>   seahorse gnumeric-common gnome-themes-extras fast-user-switch-applet dia-gnome gnome-backgrounds libgoffice-0-4 libopal-2.2 libdvdread3 __eou__ <Chronosphear>   libsidplay1 dia-common gnumeric libgpgme11 inkscape libmpeg2-4 liba52-0.7.4 __eou__ <Chronosphear> Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them. __eou__ <Chronosphear> The following packages will be REMOVED __eou__ <Chronosphear> oops, sorry __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ /media/<whatever you want> __eou__ <danbhfive> Chronospear just do it, and run the install desktop command before you reboot __eou__ <Chronosphear> danbhfive, do what? manually uninstall? __eou__ <danbhfive> install the libnss? __eou__ <Chronosphear> autoremove does nothing __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive  /can/this/be/like/this __eou__ <danbhfive> did you remove all the local packages? __eou__ <Chronosphear> oh right ok __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive  or must i start off /home/something/else __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ it can, heh, but dont confuse yourself __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ it should be under /media __eou__ <Chronosphear> ooook __eou__ <Chronosphear> it's uninstalling gnome __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive ok media/myStuff __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive doesnt give me media in the list so i entered it manually __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ /home is good for reinstalling linux, but that can come when you are more familiar with this stuff __eou__ <danbhfive> vee_ thats fine __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive kewl __eou__ <vee_> danbhfive thanx for the patience __eou__ <danbhfive> np __eou__ <danbhfive> Chronosphear, can I pm you? __eou__ <Chronosphear> danbhfive, sure __eou__

<blkthndr> I have a folder that windows reads as hidden, is there any way i can change this using ubuntu? __eou__ <blkthndr> I have a folder that windows reads as hidden, is there any way i can change this using ubuntu? __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: why are you trying to do that? __eou__ <blkthndr> its for my mp3 player __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: this is a foldaer that should not be hidden? __eou__ <blkthndr> yes it should not be hidden __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: is it hidden in windows? __eou__ <blkthndr> yes its hidden in windows, i dont have windows to change the status though __eou__ <blkthndr> the problem is that because it is a windows hidden file, my mp3 player cannot read it. __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: that dont make sense. Does your mp3 player work with Linux/Ubuntu? __eou__ <blkthndr> yes it works fine __eou__ <blkthndr> i use rockbox firmware on my mp3 player, when i boot the mp3 players original firmware it makes the music folder hidden, rockbox cannot find the hidden music folder __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: and copying the folder is unacceptable? __eou__ <blkthndr> I could copy the folder but its a huge folder __eou__ <blkthndr> and the problem will create itself again in the future __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: I understand but it should be visible. __eou__ <blkthndr> its visible to linux and ubuntu and a mac, rockbox does not see it becaues it is a windows hidden file.  when i had windows i could just unhide it, i can't do this using ubuntu because its not hidden to it __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: that's a predicament. __eou__ <blkthndr> there are ways around it so i can access my music, but i just want to know if the problem can be fixed __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: maybe you can be more specific. it does sound like a hardware issue that is solvable. __eou__ <ztomic> but I'm at a loss as to why someone would hide a music folder. __eou__ <blkthndr> Its not a hardware issue.  I'm just trying to change the hidden status of a folder, the problem is its a windows hidden folder and not a linux hidden folder __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: there-in lies the problem __eou__ <blkthndr> so there is no way I can change its hidden status without using windows? __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: perhaps linux would be able to read AMIGA floppy disks as well? Nope. aint gonna happen. __eou__ <ztomic> slightly different problem but none-the-less... it aint gonna happen. __eou__ <ztomic> blkthndr: try googling it. __eou__ <blkthndr> i've tried googling with no help for a couple days, as well as trying the support forums and irc of rockbox __eou__

However when i try to use edgy eft i can not boot into install.  The system crashes and i hear a beep and screen goes black. (if any1 could shed some light on boot options to use with f6).  The reason i am doing this is because my ati AGP card is not supported in fesity and gutsy. __eou__ <pike_> PsyDeViL: well.. if youre going to go with an older version have you considered dapper? its the long term support version __eou__ <pike_> PsyDeViL: id suggest you maybe just ebay the ati card though and buy a dirt cheap nvidia :) __eou__ <PsyDeViL> thanks pike just downloading dapper now __eou__ <PsyDeViL> will give it a shot __eou__ <PsyDeViL> its just that i downloaded edgy livecd and it wont install. - the reason i am going to old version is so i can use my gfx card. __eou__

<user_> why some people suggest me to compress a folder with tar.gz (tar -czvf backup.tar.gz /var/www) insted using gzip /var/www so it return www.gz  ?? __eou__ <user_> what is the benefit using .tar insted gz ? __eou__ <Viper> I think .tar is just an archive, no compression. __eou__ <Viper> .tar.gz is compressed... I think that's how it works. __eou__ <user_> Viper,  so why not we just use .gz than .tar.gz  ? __eou__ <danbhfive> user_ gz is just compression, for a single file, tar binds several files together __eou__ <danbhfive> user_ i think you use them both to create an archive __eou__ <danbhfive> user_ but you should use the command I have you for /home __eou__ <user_> danbhfive, so can not to gzip /var/www   is that what you mean? __eou__ <user_> danbhfive, so i must tar it first __eou__ <danbhfive> user_ i think thats the case __eou__ <user_> danbhfive, then compress it, example use gz __eou__ <user_> danbhfive, ok thanks __eou__ <danbhfive> user_ tar can gzip it for you, just add a z directive, i believe __eou__ <Viper> user_: tar -xzf /path/to/directory/to/compress __eou__ <user_> yes.. thanks __eou__ <Viper> tar -z tells the tar application to use a foreign compression app. __eou__ <user_> Viper, x is for extract __eou__ <Viper> oh... same diff... lol   tar -cz then __eou__ <user_> Viper, i think it should tar czvf __eou__ <user_> Viper,  yes.. or the simple one is cz __eou__ <Viper> I rarely find myself compressing files, decompressing is much more common for me... __eou__

So my question is this:  How can I create a panel in Gnome that disappears while Compiz & AWN are running, but comes back when I disable Compiz? __eou__ <Shujah-1> Reformer81, as far as I know only way to do that would be to increase the unhide time of bottom panel 10 times and use awn on top of it __eou__ <Reformer81> Shujah-1: Hmm...

I haven't tried it yet :)  I'm sure it will work, though. __eou__ <Reformer81> Shujah-1: But then I'm still going to need to take extra steps to make the gnome panel useful after disabling compiz. __eou__ <Shujah-1> Reformer81, make sure hide time is super short too & hide pixel are 0. __eou__ <Reformer81> Shujah-1: Well, this will work for now.  But I'm curious... isn't there someway to modify the panel's configuration file on the fly?  For example, set a "visible" attribute to zero? __eou__ <Shujah-1> Reformer81, you can probably make a script for it, place it on the desktop - But I gather that would be too much hassle for something like that __eou__

<MiketheMagiCat> Hi.  Can someone help me? I had Ubuntu installed on my computer. I also have Windows Vista (which I hate). But today it would not let me go online. It said there was a broken link. I could not find it. I uninstalled it. I installed Download Ubuntu Desktop Edition 32 bit. And then it told me when it finished downloading to choose a program to open it up. I chose Internet Explorer. Now I can't find the __eou__ <MiketheMagiCat> 	MiketheMagiCat	program anywhere on the computer, or in my files. I also tried loading it on to my usb flash drive, and it didn't work. Is there a phone number to call for support for Linux products. I am a beginner and an idiot. __eou__

You only mount partititions. __eou__ <guest__> jimbo no   wrong.  you only mount file systems.   you don't mount partitions __eou__ <jimbo> Also guys I don't think it's beneficial to name mountpoints after partition names.  They can change, and then things get very confusing. __eou__ <jimbo> guest__: fair enough __eou__ <jimbo> but filesystems exist on partitions __eou__ <guest__> jimbo you can have a file system without a partition __eou__ <guest__> jimbo on this computer for example.  my root file system is on /dev/sda   there are no partitions __eou__ <jacob_> so how should it be? could u correct it so i can copy paste just so i know im doing it right? __eou__ <guest__> jacob_ for q in sda5 sda4 sda3 sda2 sda1 sda ;do mount /dev/$q /mnt ;done __eou__ <guest__> err __eou__ <guest__> jacob_ for q in sdb5 sdb4 sdb3 sdb2 sdb1 sdb ;do mount /dev/$q /mnt ;done __eou__ <guest__> jacob_ sorry   was thinking sda  not sdb   but you get the idea.   that will mount what ever is there... __eou__ <jacob_> Im sorry but i dont understand where to start or stop copy pasting on that  =/ __eou__ <jacob_> Lol very novice ubuntuer __eou__ <guest__> jacob_   heh  the whole line execpt your nickname __eou__ <guest__> jacob_   for q in sdb5 sdb4 sdb3 sdb2 sdb1 sdb ;do sudo mount /dev/$q /mnt ;done __eou__ <rowan_> b5 sdb4 sdb3 sdb2 sdb1 sdb ;do sudo mount /dev/$q /mnt ;done __eou__ <jacob_> i get this __eou__ <jacob_> jacob@jacob-laptop:~$ for q in sda5 sda4 sda3 sda2 sda1 sdb ;do mount /dev/$q /mnt ;done __eou__ <jacob_> mount: only root can do that __eou__ <jacob_> mount: only root can do that __eou__ <FloodBot3> jacob_: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation. __eou__ <jacob_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/479505/ this is what i get __eou__ <guest__> ffr <<< for Q in sd{j..b}{8..1} sd{j..b} ;do sudo mount /dev/$Q /mnt ;done >>> mount what ever is there in the sd? range. __eou__ <jacob_> can anyone help me with the problem? __eou__ <jacob_> yashi- guest__ isnt responding could u help me again? __eou__ <jacob_> Anyone going to help me? __eou__ <juboba> jacob_: what's your problem? __eou__ <jacob_> i am trying to manually mount my external had drive , guest__ was previously helping me with it and we got to trying to put this command in but i got the error that appears http://paste.ubuntu.com/479505/ __eou__ <jacob_> the external hard drive wont mount itself __eou__ <guest__> ffr <<< for Q in sd{j..b}{8..1} sd{j..b} ;do sudo mount /dev/$Q /mnt ;done >>> mount what ever is there in the sd? range.   jacob_ __eou__ <guest__>                                  ^ __eou__ <guest__> jacob_ and the command "mount" will list what mounted. __eou__ <jacob_> guest__ for that i i get this http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/4JHwYRHT __eou__ <yashi-> jacob_: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=283131 __eou__ <thune3> jacob_: mounting 7 drives on /mnt directory will succeed but won't function (only the last drive mounted on mountpoint /mnt will be visable __eou__ <guest__> jacob_ and mount shows what ? __eou__ <jacob_> moutn shows this http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/BzqVsAX7 __eou__ <abhijit> !mount | jacob_ __eou__ <ubottu> jacob_: mount is used to attach devices to directories.

On stackoverflow.com, I have been suggested to do : "sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=20" and it seems to improve a little (the default value is 60), what do you think? __eou__ <yashi-> yanick_: actually ive no clue :P i never had that problem __eou__ <yashi-> yanick_: but imo its a ugly solution..it doesnt solve the real problem ...ubuntu shouldnt touch the swap partition at all __eou__ <yanick_> yashi-, I chose Ubuntu especially so I don't have to hack my way around kernel issues (unlike other "compile-yourself" linux distros) so I have no idea how to find/solve this problem __eou__ <younder> yanick_, lol. good luck. Never been there myself __eou__ <yashi-> yanick_: me neither. the point is your ram isnt even used 100% but linux is using the swap partition already strange __eou__ <yanick_> yashi-, or the RAM gets used really really fast, and I have to close everything to finally have some breathing room again __eou__

<seekwill> Hello. I'm trying to install Ubuntu off a USB disk. Installation seemed to have been going well, but now it's trying to retrieve some files. I'm guessing it's coming off the Internet. But it's going reallllly slow and our Internet is generally really fast. Just wondering if there is a tcpip problem, would the installer just timeout and go to the next file, or prompt with some error __eou__ <aeon-ltd> seekwill: (suggestion not solution) why don't you use the full iso instead of the network iso? __eou__ <Oer> seekwill, those last 3% depends on your internet speed __eou__ <seekwill> aeon-ltd: Hi. Well, I tried booting off a CD but that didn't seem to work for some reason. Got a bad PBR message. But luckily I had a USB disk that I used previously for a LiveCD stuff, so I tried installing from that __eou__ <seekwill> Oer: Approx how much is it downloading at the last 3%? Our normal speed is 2+MB/second, and it's been going on for over 30 minutes __eou__ <Oer> seekwill, does your router give any sign downloaden ? __eou__ <Oer> seekwill, if not, you may skip and do this after reboot. __eou__ <seekwill> Oer: Well, yes, but because I have other computers on the network I don't know who's who :) __eou__ <seekwill> Oer: Ok, thanks! __eou__

I need to upgrade to this decade. __eou__ <xmetal> i have noticed that cinn in mint 15 in lagging though in 14 on the same machine it was fine __eou__ <xmetal> i think cin 1.8 (for mint 15) and cinn 1.6 (??) for mint 14 __eou__ <xtriz> xmetal, yeah correct __eou__ <xmetal>  i am not sayings its impossible .. but if you stick with the repos ... you should be ok (as in not having DE's conflict) __eou__ <xmetal> i have not experienced any issues with having "too many DE's" __eou__ <xtriz> xmetal, good :) __eou__ <xtriz> so i can move forward experimenting things. __eou__ <Dr_Willis> ages and ages ago.. if you had kde and gnome both installed. :) it could cause weirdness.. but i havent really seen any issues with differnt de's in well.. years __eou__ <xmetal> in mint i even downloaded (i think i have the name right) "ubuntu-desktop" (I am sure this means Unity with a few extras) __eou__ <Dr_Willis> !info ubuntu-desktop __eou__ <ubottu> ubuntu-desktop (source: ubuntu-meta): The Ubuntu desktop system.

I play with some of the differnt ones. __eou__ <Dr_Willis> but they tend to be more specilized __eou__ <oicory> I actually want about 3-6 Pis because I want to play with VMs __eou__ <xmetal> ah not as bad as slackware (I love slackware but its a pain at times) ... have to install 100 dependencies from the tarballs, mannually __eou__ <xmetal> then you end up forgetting the INTIAL program you were trying to install in the first place __eou__ <xmetal> lol __eou__ <oicory> Yea, I had the same problem with Gentoo. Spent 4 hours trying to set the correct use flags to get the dependencies for Firefox __eou__ <oicory> Then forgot what I was trying to install... When went to go try to google how to do something and was like "Oh yea.

<universal> I installed ubuntu-restricted-extras package....but something went wrong and flashplugin-nstaller and mscorefonts did not install and now I downloaded flash archieve from adobe and copy pasted flash file it in browser directory ...but its still saying flash missing....whats wrong ? how to fix it ? __eou__ <Dr_Willis> universal:  id reinstall the flash-installer package from the repos. and let it do it __eou__ <Dr_Willis> universal:  the askubuntu.com site may have some guides on how to properly use the flash archive from adobe.

<Stevie24> Can anyone tell me how can I extract & delete from file1, the lines containing specific strings, and move them to a new file named file2 ? the string is dynamic; example : I'm interested to extract all lines containing DOG, 192168, IL. All 3 are separate patterns. Thanks in advance. __eou__ <histo> Stevie24: with sed __eou__ <histo> Stevie24: well grep  and sed __eou__ <histo> Stevie24: you still around? __eou__ <Stevie24> histo, sorry. I was on the phone. __eou__ <Stevie24> That means I will need a script, is that correct? __eou__ <Stevie24> Just a sed command woudn't do it? __eou__ <histo> Stevie24: you could one liner it with a ; __eou__ <Stevie24> ah, ok __eou__ <histo> Stevie24: grep searchterm somefile > newfile ; sed -ie 's/searchterm//g' somefile __eou__ <Stevie24> But isn't that impossible, since I have 24 separate strings ? __eou__ <Stevie24> That would mean 24 x grep + 24 x sed.

<skrrp> Guest7100: install BSD. joking aside there are many small and big things you can do to secure your system. start with sshd_config. move the ssh port to a high number in the user range, disable root login. use nmap to scan your system for open ports (services). disable any you don't need. kill inetd if it's running. kill any insecure ftp programs. you might consider a firewall (shorewall) or... __eou__ <skrrp> ...selinux. you could opt for just not having ports open rather than firewalls. read up on port knocking if you are truly paranoid __eou__

I googled around, but all I can find is stuff on creating the overlay, not saving current stuff to it. I know there must be some way, but I'm kinda stuck. __eou__ <k0nceast> Guest19759: not while you're booted __eou__ <k0nceast> Guest19759: it's a boot-time kernel option iirc __eou__ <Guest19759> k0nceast: Yeah, but is there some way to just dump the changes to a file and then reboot from it? __eou__ <k0nceast> depends on what you've changed __eou__ <k0nceast> you could make a folder on your windrive and save all changed config files there __eou__ <k0nceast> (eg. the files and folders in your home folder that start with a .

I know I could just re-add Universe and reinstall the stuff I've gotten, but I wonder if there's a way to create the persistant file and dump everything that's changed since boot or something __eou__ <k0nceast> Guest19759: if you've added repo's for apps, then add the /etc/sources.list file and /etc/sources.d/ dir to the folder __eou__ <k0nceast> w8 __eou__ <k0nceast> /etc/dpkg/sources.list and .d respectively __eou__ <k0nceast> and in the dpkg folder might also be a list with names of installed packages, which you could copy there as well __eou__ <histo> !clone | Guest19759 __eou__ <ubottu> Guest19759: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can use the !software package "apt-clone" - See also !automate __eou__ <k0nceast> Guest19759: and when installed, you could replace the content of the file in the install with the content of the files on your winpartition __eou__ <k0nceast> histo: No way!!! __eou__ <k0nceast> that'd saved me hours if i'd known that some years earlier __eou__ <Guest19759> Ah ok. Would be a neet feature at some point though to be able to create a persistant file from what currently is.

TBH the "easiest" way might just be a reboot (hard reboot if necessary) __eou__ <galentanner> http://pastebin.com/nWAaGzYN __eou__ <ebernhardson> dpkg looks to no longer be listed, in theory that also means dpkg is no longer locked and whatever you were trying to do with it should be possible now __eou__ <galentanner> What's the difference between a reboot and a hard reboot? __eou__ <ebernhardson> galentanner: a hard reboot is when you just shut off the power without letting the machine do a proper shutdown __eou__ <galentanner> oh.  ok. __eou__ <galentanner> I'm trying to get the Broadcom 4318 wireless card to work.  Everyone says it's supported, but I can't get it to work. __eou__ <ebernhardson> galentanner: not generally suggested, although not as dangerous now as it used to be :) but can be necessary when things that talk to the kernel get stuffed and refuse to complete (but not necessary in your current situation) __eou__ <galentanner> ok __eou__ <ebernhardson> getting hardware to work is a pain in the ass, i have an IT department that chooses laptops for me :) __eou__ <galentanner> Nice.  I am the IT department.  I'm an idiot.  I just want it to work... __eou__ <ebernhardson> :) __eou__ <galentanner> I'm trying to run these commands: __eou__ <galentanner> sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source __eou__ <galentanner> sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree __eou__ <galentanner> Should I try them now? __eou__ <ebernhardson> sounds reasonable __eou__ <galentanner> here goes.... __eou__ <galentanner> I think the first one is working now. __eou__ <galentanner> The first command seems to have finished.  Should I reboot or run the second command? __eou__ <ebernhardson> just run the next one, you hardly need to reboot a linux box __eou__ <galentanner> ok... __eou__ <galentanner> second one is chewing __eou__ <galentanner> linux-firmware-nonfree is already the newest version. __eou__ <galentanner> 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 11 not upgraded. __eou__ <galentanner> Is this ok? __eou__ <ebernhardson> it means the package is installed, and thats what you wanted, so i guess yes? __eou__ <galentanner> So the website calls for a couple modprobe commands next.... __eou__ <galentanner> sudo modprobe -rv b43 __eou__ <galentanner> sudo modprobe -v b43 __eou__ <ebernhardson> basically that means remove and re-insert the b43 driver __eou__ <galentanner> ok... __eou__ <ebernhardson> (you can `man modprobe` to get a manual page explaining all of this) __eou__ <ebernhardson> man is the manual command, works for most all things you can type into the command line __eou__ <ebernhardson> quality of the manual varies greatly though :) __eou__ <galentanner> This is what I did.. __eou__ <galentanner> galentanner@ubuntu:~$ sudo modprobe -rv b43 __eou__ <galentanner> galentanner@ubuntu:~$ sudo modprobe -v b43 __eou__ <galentanner> insmod /lib/modules/3.13.0-46-generic/kernel/drivers/ssb/ssb.ko __eou__ <galentanner> The website says I may need to reboot now.  Should I? __eou__ <ebernhardson> it seems odd they want you to remove and reinsert the kernel module, then reboot.  but sure why not __eou__ <galentanner> Then the wireless should be working, you think? __eou__ <ebernhardson> a definite maybe :) __eou__ <galentanner> I'll be back in a jif....BTW, thanks for the help.  You are very kind a patient. __eou__ <galentanner> and patient... __eou__ <ebernhardson> np __eou__ <galentanner> ugh! __eou__ <galentanner> brb __eou__ <galentanner> WOO HOO!  IT WORKS! __eou__ <galentanner> I have been messing with this thing for three weeks! __eou__ <KurisuIRC> What was wrong galentanner ? __eou__ <ebernhardson> galentanner: congratz :) __eou__ <galentanner> I'm a step closer to having a functioning computer again!! __eou__ <galentanner> Ebernhardson, You are truly a gentleman and a scholar! __eou__ <galentanner> Is there a way to reach out to you again if...when I need help? __eou__ <KurisuIRC> galentanner, probably just come back here if you need help. __eou__ <KurisuIRC> galentanner, just ping him if you want him specifically __eou__ <ebernhardson> yea, theres plenty of smart people in here that can help you __eou__ * KurisuIRC blushes __eou__ <galentanner> how do I ping? __eou__ <KurisuIRC> just type their name __eou__ <galentanner> ebernhardson __eou__ <KurisuIRC> like when i type galentanner it should highlight in chat, and depending on the client, make a ding noise __eou__ <galentanner> did that ping you? __eou__ <KurisuIRC> looks like it did from here __eou__ <ebernhardson> yes, although i have my pings mostly silent, it just changes the rooms active color from white to red __eou__ <galentanner> cool. That's awesome! __eou__ <KurisuIRC> #justircthings __eou__ <galentanner> Thanks all.  I've read that fixing the wireless might allow the computer to actually poweroff.  What do you think? __eou__ <ebernhardson> depends why it wont power off ) __eou__ <KurisuIRC> ...? what was the problem originally __eou__ <ebernhardson> sometimes if it wont power off you can ctrl-alt-F7 (or F1, F2, try them all) to end up at a screen that has some debug output __eou__ <ebernhardson> but only sometimes __eou__ <galentanner> It just sits there and runs after restart or shutdown command either from GUI or from the command line.  I have to unplug the battery and the power cord to get it to shut off. __eou__ <ebernhardson> also instead of unplugging everything, many computers and laptops will force a shutdown if you just hold the power button for >5s __eou__ <galentanner> I've tried that.  doesn't work here. __eou__ <ebernhardson> :( __eou__ <galentanner> So, If I use the shutdown command in the gui system.  The screen will go black.  After a few minutes, I, Instead of unplugging everything, try the ctrl-alt- F7...etc.  That should generate some code? __eou__ <ebernhardson> if your lucky, one of them will have some debug output on them.  Its not really generated at that point though basically those are virtual terminals that always exist but are not typically seen these days because everything boots straight into GUI __eou__ <galentanner> SO, If is hit those buttons, the system will send the report the next startup? __eou__ <ebernhardson> sorry no, i mean those are text consoles (like the one you type your commands into in the gui) that still exist from the days before GUI was popular __eou__ <ebernhardson> if you are lucky some debug output goes to one of them when shutting down __eou__ <ebernhardson> they wont persist through a reboot __eou__ <galentanner> so, I'll see the output, write it downand send it out. __eou__ <ebernhardson> a picture with your phone might be easier than writing it down :) __eou__ <galentanner> ok.  I can send that to you if I get anything? __eou__ <ebernhardson> you can just post it here __eou__ <galentanner> ok  I'll see you guys in the ether!  PEacE!  and thanks again! __eou__ <galentanner> Ladies and Gentlemen.  Ebernhardson is my savior. He stuck with me and helped me fix my problem that has been plaguing me since I installed Xbuntu 14.04.  My WiFi works and the computer now shuts down and off as it is expected to do!  Thank you so much Ebernhardson! __eou__ <tryhard2> hip hop huuray for Ebernhardson! __eou__ <galentanner> This was the solution: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2174511&page=8 __eou__ <galentanner> Goodnight to all!

<darius93> I have a question about shred, it is said that it zeros the file (or partition if one decide to use that feature) but when it comes to zeroing a file, why does it run so fast? I havent tried using it with a partition but if I use dd to destroy a file, it takes slightly longer depending on if its a hdd, ssd, whats io operations going on on disk, etc __eou__ <rypervenche> darius93: If you're using dd on a disk, it's using 512 bytes by default, which is extremely slow. If you were to use 32M for example for the byte size, it would go much more quickly. __eou__ <darius93> Ah that explains it but I generally use 1M __eou__ <rypervenche> darius93: I've also found shred to be a little slow, but I've never done a side-by-side. They are both binaries that do different things, so yeah. __eou__ <darius93> rypervenche, i never used it against a drive itself, just files to securely erase them, but i guess it varies. Shred does do several passes through the file (i think 4 or 24 passes by default) which is why it is slower than dd which only does one pass through __eou__ <rypervenche> darius93: Yep, there is that as well. 3 by default. __eou__
<cage> If I encrypt my "home directory" __eou__ <cage> Then I have all my files there. How safe is that __eou__ <cage> I'm trying to refer to files in other places, suchs as temporary files __eou__ <cage> Or what is the status quo on ubuntu encryption? __eou__ <darius93> cage, as long as you keep your key safe, your home directory should be safe in theory. I do not know the extent of the security but i do know its pretty secured from stories __eou__ <rypervenche> cage: Well, so long as the directory is decrypted your files are just as opened as unencrypted files. __eou__ <rypervenche> cage: It is only when your home directory is not decrypted (i.e., your machine is turned off) that you will have the security. __eou__ <treelzebub> encrypted home dir + vpn should be just fine for most people __eou__ <rypervenche> I personally don't use an encrypted home dir, but rather a LUKS encrypted disk. I have seen people have problems with encrypted home directories from time to time. __eou__ <treelzebub> LUKS totally screwed up my boot partition. i gave it 2 months, and spent lots of time with awesome people in this channel. __eou__ <rypervenche> treelzebub: Our of curiosity, what went wrong? __eou__ <darius93> im curious as to what went wrong as well __eou__ <rypervenche> I don't think I have ever seen anyone have a problem with a LUKS-encrypted drive or partition before. __eou__ <treelzebub> hold. finding relevant info __eou__ <treelzebub> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecryptfs-utils/+bug/1310058 __eou__ <ubottu> Launchpad bug 953875 in ecryptfs-utils (Ubuntu Vivid) "duplicate for #1310058 Encrypted swap no longer mounted at bootup" [High,Fix released __eou__ <treelzebub> Fix released, eh?

Either LUKS or something proprietary. __eou__ <rypervenche> cage: I would recommend LUKS though. It is part of the Linux kernel. __eou__ <cage> okay __eou__ <Myrtti> /boot isn't encrypted. __eou__ <cage> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemHowto3 __eou__ <cage> Should this be enough? __eou__

<newuser789> what kind of file .zsync is ? what to do with it ? zetheroo1 http://mirror.yandex.ru/ubuntu-cdimage/releases/14.04.2/release/ __eou__ <geirha> newuser789: zsync is a way to download similar files without downloading everything each time __eou__ <newuser789> geirha: just like torrent or something else ? and how to use it ? __eou__ <geirha> newuser789: the file is split into sizable pieces, then checksums for each piece is stored in the .zsync file.  When you download with zsync, you provide it with similar files you've already downloaded. It checks those files if they have any matching pieces, and only downloads any missing ones. __eou__ <geirha> newuser789: It's mainly for the daily images, where today's and yesterday's image likely only contains a few differences. So you might end up downloading 10% of the actual size instead of 100% __eou__ <newuser789> geirha: sounds like its same as torrent, files are split and their hashes are stored in torrent file, when we download then it checks for missing pieces and downloads the missing ones __eou__ <geirha> newuser789: similar, sure, but you only download from the one server, not other peers __eou__ <newuser789> geirha: ohh, so zsync is centralized to a single server and torrent is decentralized to seeds and peers, torrents can be dangerous but zsync will be verified by server __eou__ <newuser789> so how to use zsync ? __eou__ <jbo> sorry but I don't know __eou__ <k1l> newuser789: read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ZsyncCdImage __eou__ <k1l> but you could just md5sum for the isos __eou__ <newuser789> k1l: what are md5sums-metalink, md5sums-metalink.gpg and md5sums.gpg files ? what I know is that gpg is an encryption tool and how to use these files ? __eou__ <k1l> newuser789: read this for md5sum checks https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM __eou__ <newuser789> k1l: the page has no mention to md5sums-metalink and md5sums-metalink.gpg https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM __eou__ <k1l> what link? __eou__ <newuser789> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM __eou__ <newuser789> files here ---> http://mirror.yandex.ru/ubuntu-cdimage/releases/14.04.2/release/ __eou__ <k1l> newuser789: you are using wubi? __eou__ <newuser789> k1l: wubi ? __eou__ <k1l> newuser789: they are/were used for the wubi installer. but that is not recommended anymore __eou__ <newuser789> no, I'm downloading ubuntu 14.04.2 and 14.10 images for installation so asking about md5sums, same-metalink and same-metalink.gpg files.

Please check that the PPA name or format is correct. __eou__ <Guy1524_> that was a type __eou__ <Guy1524_> *typo __eou__ <Guy1524_> sudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install java8-installer __eou__ <Guy1524_> try that one __eou__ <Guy1524_> I forgot the d in update lol __eou__ <Guy1524_> nick420: I got to go, good luck __eou__ <nick420> thanx.. __eou__ <nick420> hope it works __eou__ <nick420>  Unable to locate package java8-installer __eou__ <silvian> @nick420: try the following __eou__ <silvian> sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre __eou__ <nick420> does anybody else have any suggestions for my java issue __eou__ <silvian> and then try installing jdk as well __eou__ <silvian> sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk __eou__ <silvian> which ubuntu version have you got installed? __eou__ <nick420> 14.04 i think __eou__ <nick420> im very new to it __eou__ <silvian> ok did that work? __eou__ <nick420> well it seems to download everything properly but it still promts me the same thing when i try to open the game __eou__ <nick420> could it be the game? __eou__ <silvian> what is teh verion of minecraft you're running? __eou__ <silvian> it probably requires java 8 __eou__ <silvian> version __eou__ <silvian> i can't spell today it seems :P __eou__ <nick420> im not even sure. i cant open it and my friend put it on here __eou__ <silvian> right lets try installing oracle's java 8 __eou__ <silvian> it might help... __eou__ <nick420> thanx for ur patience __eou__ <silvian> rung the following furst __eou__ <silvian> first __eou__ <silvian> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java __eou__ <silvian> does it add it successfully? __eou__ <nick420> Important!!! For now, you should continue to use Java 8 because Oracle Java 9 is available as an early access release (it should be released in 2016)! You should only use Oracle Java 9 if you explicitly need it, because it may contain bugs and it might not include the latest security patches! __eou__ <reisio> icedtea should really work __eou__ <silvian> yeah i gave you the ppa for java 8 __eou__ <silvian> :) __eou__ <silvian> has it added it to the ppa list? __eou__ <nick420> ok. seems good __eou__ <silvian> ok __eou__ <silvian> now do __eou__ <silvian> sudo apt-get update __eou__ <silvian> to refresh your ppa library __eou__ <nick420> ok done __eou__ <silvian> good now run __eou__ <silvian> sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer __eou__ <nick420> going to take a few minutes __eou__ <silvian> @nick420: sure... sounds like you're the right track anyway __eou__ <silvian> after that's finished doing everything __eou__ <silvian> run java --version __eou__ <silvian> to confirm you got java 1.8 installed :) __eou__ <tsapii> you could find it using `which` __eou__ <tgm4883> nick420: you're just trying to play minecraft? How did you install java? __eou__ <tsapii> e.g. for me, `which java` produces /usr/bin/java __eou__ <tgm4883> silvian: tell me to go away if you've got this covered :) __eou__ <tsapii> which is a symlink to /etc/alternatives/java, which in turn is a symlink to /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java __eou__ <nick420> not that i see anywhere no __eou__ <silvian> no worries :) your help is appreciated __eou__ <silvian> yeah try typing which java __eou__ <silvian> it might installed somewhere else __eou__ <silvian> usually its /usr/lib __eou__ <tsapii> readlink -f `which java` should reveal its path __eou__ <dragonbite> If all you are doing is Minecraft, openjdk-7-jre also works and it is in the repos. __eou__ <silvian> @nick420: try typing this __eou__ <silvian> readlink -f `which java` __eou__ <silvian> it should reveal exact path as tsapii suggested __eou__ <silvian> so we can add it to your java home __eou__ <tgm4883> nick420: How did you install java? And is this openjdk? All I needed to do was install openjdk-8-jre and then run the jar __eou__ <tgm4883> (although technically, I run it through multimc since I like lots of mods) __eou__ <silvian> no its oracle's. We had no luck getting minecraft working with open jdk __eou__ <dragonbite> can run using "java -jar <path to>/Minecraft.jar __eou__ <nick420> silvian gave me a walk through and all seemed to work but the game will still not open __eou__ <silvian> had to install oracle jdk for him __eou__ <dragonbite> sorry, "java -jar <path to>/Minecraft.jar" (without quotes) __eou__ <tgm4883> silvian: was there an error? What version of minecraft? It should work fine with openjdk __eou__ <silvian> yeah that's what i though... no nick420 didn't specify the error __eou__ <silvian> anyway should be there configuring this... we just need to set $JAVA_HOME environment variable __eou__ <silvian> so I've asked nick420 to run: readlink -f `which java` __eou__ <silvian> to find out what the install path is __eou__ <dragonbite> silvian: what about trying to uninstall it and then install openjdk or oracle java again? __eou__ * tgm4883 wonders if it's not a java issue... __eou__ <silvian> its installed fine i think its just a matter of configuring JAVA_HOME now __eou__ <nick420> it says this /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java __eou__ <silvian> good ok now copy that exactly into your clipboard __eou__ <silvian> and now run export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java __eou__ <nick420> clipboard..? lol __eou__ <silvian> whatever... ctrl +C __eou__ <silvian> :P __eou__ <silvian> just paste this and run it __eou__ <silvian> export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java __eou__ <nick420> i pasted "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java" and nothing happend __eou__ <tsapii> nick420: you specified the java binary as JAVA_HOME __eou__ <tsapii> remove the "bin/java" part __eou__ <silvian> that's fine __eou__ <silvian> it gives you no output back __eou__ <silvian> just hit return key __eou__ <silvian> then close down your terminal __eou__ <silvian> and open it again __eou__ <silvian> then try running minecraft __eou__ <silvian> it should be set now __eou__ <tsapii> …is it fine to specify it to the binary path? could've sworn that it had to be left out __eou__ <nick420> negative. says the same thing :( __eou__ <nick420> should i give up lol __eou__ <tgm4883> silvian: closing and reopening the terminal wipes the export __eou__ <tsapii> yeah __eou__ <tsapii> should add it to .bashrc __eou__ <tgm4883> well, should export it first and see if it works __eou__ <tgm4883> only add it to .bashrc if it works __eou__ <tsapii> true __eou__ <silvian> yeah repeat the export task again in bash terminal __eou__ <tgm4883> silvian: also, you set his java_home wrong __eou__ <nick420> export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   ??

<patarr> hello. Why is it that when I have a txt file with packages (line by line) it does not work with sudo apt-get install $(cat packages.txt) ? __eou__ <patarr> It gives me an error E: Unable to locate package x for lots of packages that I know exist. I can even just install them manually with install "package" __eou__ <EriC^^> patarr: what does it say? __eou__ <EriC^^> can you paste the file? __eou__ <patarr> EriC^^, it's libreoffice, build-essential, tmux, vim on separate lines. __eou__ <EriC^^> patarr: oh, it won't work on separate lines, try xargs -a /file sudo apt-get install instead __eou__ <patarr> EriC^^, this SO answer says it should work both ways :( I also tried the xargs command in there. I will try yours as well http://askubuntu.com/questions/541781/install-list-of-packages-using-apt-get __eou__ <patarr> EriC^^, same issue with your command :( __eou__ <EriC^^> patarr: something else is wrong __eou__ <EriC^^> patarr: btw i think they meant $(cat pkglist) only works if you have them side by side, and xargs for the other __eou__ <patarr> EriC^^, I tried both - but I think I found the issue. Line endings. I made the file on windows. Wrote the file again in vim on the OS, and it seems to work. __eou__ <patarr> Damn line endings. __eou__ <EriC^^> oh __eou__

I forgot. __eou__ <SchrodingersScat> travisthenavi: is there even a virtual package for 'lamp'? __eou__
<datamancer_> Hi all. How can I update Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 to 14.04.4? __eou__ <tgm4883> datamancer_: you get it via regular apt updates __eou__ <datamancer_> tgm4883: Right, thanks, but I'm a bit confused as to which command to run to do it. Is it apt-get upgrade? __eou__ <tgm4883> datamancer_: yes __eou__ <datamancer_> tgm4883: tyvm :) __eou__ <Bashing-om> datamancer_: " sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade ; sudo apt full-upgrade " should be all there is to it . __eou__
<latenite_> Hi folks, how can I determine when the latest firefox update was available for update? __eou__ <sethj> when it *was* or when it *will be*? __eou__ <xangua> latenite_: check Firefox releases notes? Wikipedia history release? __eou__ <latenite_> xangua, I mean when it made its way to ubuntu. __eou__ <latenite_> xangua, I want to compare the release dates of the offical sites of firefox to the dates of some distros __eou__ <latenite_> anyone? I don't use ubuntu and could really use some help here :D __eou__ <Bashing-om> latenite_: Then there is a need for you to run ubuntu . __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: why? __eou__ <latenite_> Bashing-om, I was hoping to find the data I need online in the repos or some git... __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, so I can compare how fast/slow software updates get into the different distros. __eou__ <dragonbite> latenite: have you looked at http://packages.ubuntu.com ?  It doesn't give you the date but gives you the version __eou__ <Bashing-om> latenite_: You can always ask, if it is not ubuntu related we can redirect so you get the help you need . Ask your question . __eou__ <latenite_> Bashing-om, tgm4883 xangua on gentoo it was easy for firefox https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/www-client/firefox/firefox-44.0.2.ebuild?id=2b761e9d635fee7a8c3ab20dfa54e20c0c1d737c __eou__ <latenite_> 3 days __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: you'd need to go through the mailing list to get the upload dates I believe __eou__ <ks3> latenite_: If you're looking in the repos why couldn't you use the timestamp of the package? __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, there is no logging or git? When it comes to ubuntu repos? __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: what ks3 said. That seems to be the best solution http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/firefox/ __eou__ <latenite_> ks3, I found this file http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/wily/main/binary-amd64/ __eou__ <latenite_> but there are not time stamps __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: look at the link I posted __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, so http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/firefox/firefox-dbg_44.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.15.10.1_amd64.deb is from 11-Feb-2016 20:39 __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, I wonder if there is a TIME on the offical release by mozilla?! __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? Because it doesn't really seem like a support issue __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, it's about getting to know how much time passed from mozillas offical release until available in ubuntu15 __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: but why __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, to compare to other distros. There seem to be big differences in time... __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: which is worthless IMO and doesn't make me want to drop what I'm doing to help you __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: honestly though, what's your end game here? __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, it sparked a discussion in our LUG ... So I am investigating on it. The whole idea started with this: http://segfault.linuxmint.com/2013/11/answering-controversy-stability-vs-security-is-something-you-configure/ __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: yea, that's about what I figured started this.... __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, our members wonder what the real difference is, when it comes to time and updates __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: ok, so I would probably forget about the timestamp then and just focus on the date __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: 1) because you're talking times, but unsure about what timezone the server is in __eou__ <latenite_> true , good point __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: and 2) we're talking hours here, which is meaningless __eou__ <Pici> latenite_: I missed part of the conversation here, but are you looking for something like this? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+publishinghistory __eou__ <tgm4883> latenite_: ^^ __eou__ <tgm4883> Pici: that is perfect, exactly what he's looking for __eou__ <tgm4883> and way better than what I gave him __eou__ <latenite_> Pici, great __eou__ <Pici> :) __eou__ <latenite_> tgm4883, so its UTC :D __eou__ <latenite_> we can start being picky about hours now :D __eou__

<epifanio__> Ben64, big brother debian said: remove the copy .. and copy it again using sudo __eou__ <epifanio__> and that fixed it __eou__ <Ben64> epifanio__: ok, don't come here for debian support __eou__ <epifanio__> Ben64 OK .. I should not come here for anything related to unix then .. becouse those basic things are the same on all *nix OS __eou__ <epifanio__> i thing you are a bit racist .. __eou__ <epifanio__> ciao __eou__ <Ben64> epifanio__: it's called #ubuntu ... if you want unix there is a channel for that, for general linux there is ##linux for debian there is #debian. use the proper channels, don't be dumb __eou__ <epifanio__> Ben64, you are perfectly right. I tried .. is late, i'm still at work and I left my laptop at home which is logged on irc and on linux and unix you can't post if you are not authenticated .. thet's the reason of all those underscore with my username __eou__ <epifanio__> anyway .. thanjks __eou__

<Gnomethrower> Hey everyone. I was wondering if anyone knows a tool like fuser or lsof that works on FUSE filesystems when they crash __eou__ <ikonia> fuse file system ? __eou__ <ikonia> it's not actually a file system, it's just how it's presented to the user over the network __eou__ <ikonia> eg: samba - is not actually a file system __eou__ <Gnomethrower> specifically, if MooseFS or LizardFS or GlusterFS FUSE client crashes, with dir /storage/lfs as the mountpoint, I can't umount /storage/lfs until I kill anything using it. lsof and fuser however are useless in this scenario and do not work with crashed FUSE mountpoints __eou__ <Gnomethrower> ikonia: in this case I'm talking about actual filesystems. I'm aware FUSE is for other stuff too __eou__ <ikonia> Gnomethrower: what file system are you actually talking about then __eou__ <Gnomethrower> ikonia: LizardFS in this case, but we've seen the same behaviour from Gluster and MooseFS __eou__ <ikonia> Gnomethrower: isn't this the same situation as any remote userspace mount, as then the mount goes the userdata/status is lost __eou__ <ikonia> so when you remount tools like lsof won't show anything __eou__ <ikonia> so you fix it on the server which the file system is not a userspace mount, it's a local file system __eou__ <Gnomethrower> ikonia: I'm not worried about remounting losing the status __eou__ <Gnomethrower> ikonia: I'm wanting to unmount it from a client, but it won't let me while for example nginx is running __eou__ <Gnomethrower> and usually lsof/fuser would tell you what to kill to be able to successfully umount __eou__ <Gnomethrower> but lsof and fuser do not work on a crashed FUSE mountpoint __eou__ <Gnomethrower> okay, apparently this is a kernel limitation and there's really no easy solution __eou__ <Gnomethrower> so consider my question solved I guess __eou__

<Snowie> hi all. got thinking about security and decided to look for what open ports there are on my machine. for some reason it looks like wesnoth from the repositories is still running as a daemon, but it's no longer installed on my system. how do i go about hunting it down and killing it, or at least stop the port listening. is it worth being worried? __eou__ <lyze> Snowie, if you are behind a firewall then nah ... normally not __eou__ <lyze> you should only be worried about that if you can access the computer via the itnernet __eou__ <Snowie> lyze: my WAN router is my firewall, that is all. __eou__ <lyze> Snowie, well is the port opened there? __eou__ <Snowie> I have played wesnoth online so, i guess, yeah. __eou__ <lyze> Snowie, well that's a outgoing connection and not a incoming probably since you have connected to a server and not people to your computer. __eou__ <Snowie> lyze: yeah, i see. makes sense. bugs me now that i've seen it though lol. ok, i'll stress less. __eou__ <Snowie> lyze: actually, the game has LAN support, which i guess is why it's listening, but that doesn't mean it will upnp configure the router for incoming right? __eou__ <lyze> Snowie, it should not! But I guess you can simply test it, http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ or something like that ^^ __eou__ <Snowie> lyze: closed, thanks lyze :) __eou__

__eou__ <marlo_> (not virtual box, the error) __eou__ <ikonia> what is triggering the call to that script __eou__ <ikonia> I assume it's something within the custom initrd ? __eou__ <marlo_> well, from what I've observed, updates to the system involve updates to initrd from virtualbox __eou__ <marlo_> so that's part of it's typical function, beyond me __eou__ <marlo_> but now something in there is broke with it, i cannot even remove --purge virtual box __eou__ <marlo_> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/17114572/ __eou__ <ikonia> marlo_: thats not how it should work __eou__ <ikonia> why would you need something about virtualbox in the pre-boot environment ? __eou__ <marlo_> ikonia, beats me __eou__ <marlo_> i've downloaded and installed it for years __eou__ <ikonia> you won't be "purge" virtualbox as a package if you installed it as a non-package __eou__ <marlo_> it always seems to hook something in to initrd __eou__ <ikonia> so you may need to manually edit the initrd __eou__ <ogra_> nah __eou__ <marlo_> well, i download a deb and dpkg on it __eou__ <marlo_> to install it __eou__ <ogra_> mv /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/vdfuse __eou__ <ogra_> sudo update-initramfs -u __eou__ <ogra_> done ... __eou__ <ikonia> ogra_: thats a much nicer way __eou__ <ogra_> err __eou__ <ikonia> lovely __eou__ <ogra_>  mv /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/vdfuse . __eou__ <akik> marlo_: the package name is probably virtualbox-5.0 __eou__ <marlo_> yup __eou__ <marlo_> it is __eou__ <marlo_> ! __eou__ <marlo_> 5.0_5.0.14 __eou__ <akik> i don't think vdfuse is a part of it(?). it was to do with mounting the virtual image files __eou__ <ogra_> if it would have been ppart of any package "dpkg -S" would have known __eou__ <ogra_> it definitely isnt __eou__ <akik> nope __eou__ <marlo_> ogra_, working now!  thank you, sir! __eou__ <marlo_> that was driving me mental __eou__ <ogra_> enjoy :) __eou__ <marlo_> i'm imaging my virtual box is broken now? __eou__ <marlo_> but no matter __eou__ <marlo_> i can sort that one out __eou__ <marlo_> this was keeping me from upgrading anything __eou__ <akik> marlo_: vdfuse is not part of virtualbox per se __eou__ <marlo_> akik, it is in my Downloads folder, and has some vb stuff in it __eou__ <marlo_> so it must have come from that install? __eou__ <marlo_> ogra_, ooo laa laa... it's nice watching my apt update once again __eou__ <ogra_> :) __eou__ <akik> marlo_: no it's not part of virtualbox-5.0 __eou__ <marlo_> brb, i have to see if i can reboot this machine now... something else that broke in all this mess... __eou__ <marlo_> ogra_, yahooo! it reboots as well... i haven't rebooted this computer in months because of this __eou__ <marlo_> thank you again so much! __eou__ <ogra_> no problem :) __eou__ <marlo_> i have one computer left in this office with windows through no choice of my own, i freaking love linux __eou__

<R13ose> I get this notification of the "important os and application updates are ready to be installed" but unsure what this is for, any ideas? __eou__ <ikonia> R13ose: it means there are updates available to you __eou__ <ikonia> it would be wise to apply the __eou__ <ikonia> them __eou__ <R13ose> ikonia: yes but which updates? __eou__ <BluesKaj> it's exactly what it says important updates for your Operating System (os) , R13ose...the package manager doesn't lie :-) __eou__ <Pici> I'm pretty sure the gui will tell you which ones once you click through that (although I don't use Ubuntu Desktop, so ymmv) __eou__ <BluesKaj> R13ose:  use the sudo apt upgrade command in the terminal too see what they are __eou__ <BluesKaj> too=to __eou__ <R13ose> that works. __eou__ <ikonia> R13ose: all of them __eou__ <R13ose> ikonia: Yes but I want to get rid of the packages and I thought there was a command for that. __eou__

<doublel93> hey , someone knows how to see on which port is vnc4server running ? __eou__ <Pici> doublel93: I'd guess 5900, as thats the standard vnc port __eou__ <lyze> doublel93, netstat -tulpn __eou__ <doublel93> 5901, I've installed vncserver and then vnc4server I feel so confused, vnc4server is telling me "connection refused by the host computer", any idea ? __eou__ <doublel93> still with vnc4server ,  if I start it with "vncserver"  I can connect to it, but if I start with "vncserver -geometry 1280x720 -randr 1280x720" on the client sais connection refused by the host, why is that ? __eou__

<Guest22397> Hi I added a command to /etc/rc.local to disable ethernet device on startup but it doesn't work. When I execute it after login it works. What am I missing there ? Thanks __eou__ <hateball> !patience __eou__ <ubottu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you.

<jimbotux> hello! Wondering if anyone could advise on something im trying to figure out with ulimits and differences between 1604 & 1404 LTS versions __eou__ <jimbotux> when making changes to /etc/security/limits.conf in 1604 it doesnt seem i need to add anything like "session required         pam_limits.so" __eou__ <jimbotux> to my common sessions for it to pickup the ulimit changes __eou__ <jimbotux> but with 1404 without those changes the user in question wont get the limits edit... __eou__ <jimbotux> does anyone know if this is maybe something to do with systemd and logind..? i can see pam_systemd mentioned now in common-sessions as standard in 1604. __eou__ <jimbotux> Any help or advice would be great cheers. __eou__ <ikonia> jimbotux: interesting so are you seeing limits being updated real time ? __eou__ <jimbotux> ikonia, so i make the change then sudo su - USERNAME and changes are there in 1604 __eou__ <ikonia> jimbotux: ahh, that isn't a surprise __eou__ <ikonia> as that is a session parameter __eou__ <jimbotux> ikonia, but 1404 nothing until i add the common sessions. __eou__ <ikonia> jimbotux: that sort of makes sense __eou__ <jimbotux> ikonia, Could you explain why please? Im scratching my head..am i missing something or has something changed. Thanks __eou__
<kapad> need help with setting up my touchpad. I'm using a Dell E7470.

<sveinse> I'm trying to get crashplan running on a NAS server running 16.04, and I keep getting not-found by stsremctl status crashplan, despite that a service has been installed to /etc/init.d. I thought systemctl evaluated legacy init.d services as well. What can I do to proceed the debugging? __eou__ <ikonia> sveinse: no it won't __eou__ <ikonia> sveinse: list the unit files __eou__ <sveinse> ikonia: ? list unit files? __eou__ <ikonia> sveinse: yes the systemd __eou__ <ikonia> sveinse: as /etc/init.d means nothing __eou__ <ikonia> sveinse: I assume this is not coming from the ubuntu repo __eou__ <ikonia> rather some 3rd party repo __eou__ <sveinse> ikonia: But why does ubuntu maintain /etc/rc*.d/ then? That is lecacy init.d isn't it? __eou__ <ikonia> sveinse: yes, as some upstart scripts are wrapped __eou__
